.SH NAME
.B shell - simple command line interpreter (UNIX)

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBshell\fR [command] [argument...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.br
shell is a simple command line interpreter that reads commands from the
terminal (standard input) and executes them.

.B Invocation
.br
The shell can be invoked interactively and non-interactively.
.br
The interactive shell reads commands from user input on a \fbtty\fR, and will
prompt the user before each command with $ when ready.
.br
The non-interactive shell will read commands and and executes in order given.

.B Commands
.br
The shell reads the given input and splits it into tokens if the input is more
than one word. The first word is recognised as the command and any additional
words are recognised as arguments to the command. The shell then performs the
following actions:
.br

1. Compares to a list of built-ins. If the word matches a built-in, the
corresponding function is executed. A new line with \fB$\fR follows the
execution, waiting for a new command (unless the ‘\fbexit\fR’ function is run,
which exits the parent process).
.br

2. Checks if the first word starts with a ‘\fB/\fR’. If it starts with a
‘\fB/\fR’, the shell goes directly to the path (all the characters following the
‘\fB/\fR’ and before the delimiter (space) and executes the command. If the path
is not found, an error message is displayed in the following format: “first word
: command not found”
.br

3. If the word does not start with a ‘\fB/\fR’, the shell lists all paths,
splits the string into tokens with delimiter ‘\fB:\fR’ and concatenates the
command onto the end of each directory to find an existing executable. If the
executable is found, the shell forks into a child process and executes the
command along with any arguments. A new line with \fB$\fR follows the executed
command, and waits for a new command.

.B Exit Status
.br
Returns the exit status of the last command executed.

.B Built-in Commands
.br
\fBcd\fR
.br
- changes the current directory to given path. If no argument is given,
assumed directory is $HOME
.br
\fBenv\fR
.br
- prints all environment variables
.br
\fBexit\fR
.br
- exits parent process (exits shell)
.br
\fBhelp\fR
.br
- opens help page for builtins.
Example: \fBhelp env\fR will open up the help page for env built in.
